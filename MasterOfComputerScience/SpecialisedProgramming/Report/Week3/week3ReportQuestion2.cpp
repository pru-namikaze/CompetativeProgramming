 Problem Statement for BearPair


Problem Statement
        
Bear Limak loves algorithms, especially the ones with words and strings.



Limak's friend recently entered a programming competition and wrote a program. The program contains a string constant s. Limak would now like to challenge the program by making it exceed the time limit. To do that, he must find two different characters in s that are as far apart as possible.



Formally, Limak must find two integers i and j with the following properties:

Both i and j must be valid indices into s. That is, both numbers must be between 0 and n-1, inclusive, where n is the length of s.
The characters s[i] and s[j] must be different.
The difference between i and j must be as large as possible.


You are given the String s. If Limak cannot choose any integers with the required properties, return -1. Otherwise, return the largest possible difference between i and j.

 
Definition
        
Class:    BearPair
Method:    bigDistance
Parameters:    String
Returns:    int
Method signature:    int bigDistance(String s)
(be sure your method is public)
    
 
Constraints
-    s will have between 2 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-    Each character in s will be a lowercase English letter ('a' - 'z').
 
Examples
0)
        
"bear"
Returns: 3
Limak can choose the (0-based) indices 0 and 3. We have s[0]='b' and s[3]='r', which are indeed two different letters. The difference between the two indices is 3-0 = 3.
1)
        
"abcba"
Returns: 3
Here, one optimal solution is for Limak to choose the indices 1 and 4 (corresponding to 'b' and 'a', respectively). Another optimal solution is to choose indices 0 and 3 (letters 'a' and 'b'). In both cases the difference is 3.
2)
        
"oooohyeahpotato"
Returns: 13
3)
        
"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
Returns: -1
Here, Limak can't choose two indices with different letters.
4)
        
"qw"
Returns: 1
5)
        
"xxyyxyxyyyyyyxxxyxyxxxyxyxyyyyyxxxxxxyyyyyyyyxxxxx"
Returns: 47
